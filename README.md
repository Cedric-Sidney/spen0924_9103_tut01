## Project Overview

Welcome to **Shidi Peng's IDEA9103 Final Project**!  
Our goal is to recreate a famous artwork using **p5.js**, blending creative coding with conceptual depth.

Our team consists of **4 members**, each contributing to design, development, and storytelling.

## Imaging Technique Inspiration

I’m inspired by the **low-fidelity, pixelated layering** technique used in the images below. Rectangles are added bit by bit to form a blurry face, revealing the impressionistic nature of human memory—distorted, faded, and fragmented.

This technique reflects how we recall information: not all at once, but in scattered fragments that gradually coalesce. I aim to incorporate this **gradual build-up** and **Lo-fi aesthetic** into my project to simulate the process of memory reconstruction.

## Coding Technique Exploration

I want to **gradually reconstruct an image** by randomly selecting and drawing pixel blocks over time, mimicking the process of memory recall.

The technique I found doesn't match my idea exactly, it draws randomly sized pixelated rectangles in random locations. However, it still inspires me. I plan to **modify it** so that the blocks **accumulate in their correct positions**, gradually revealing the full image.
